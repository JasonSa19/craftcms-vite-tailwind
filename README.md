# CraftCMS Starter Project with vite.js and built-in tailwindcss support


## useful console commands:

### Start local-staging with code-watching and hmr:

```
ddev npm run dev
```

### Build the assets for a production environment:

Note: production only works after the .env variable is set from "dev" to "production"!

```
ddev npm run build
```
